And those costs could go up the longer such measures drag on.\nIn response to the accelerating pandemic, a growing number of states have banned all nonessential activities and asked residents to stay home. Across the country, colleges and offices have gone entirely online, schools and restaurants are closed and nursing homes are barring visitors. Such social distancing\u00a0can stop, or at least slow, the spread of COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus (SN: 3/13/20).\nBut \u201cfor some people, a lack of social connectedness feels as impactful as not eating,\u201d says Joshua Morganstein, a psychiatrist and disaster mental health expert at the Uniformed Services University in Bethesda, Md.\nResearch on the psychological toll of social distancing during epidemics is limited. But a review in the March 14\u00a0Lancet\u00a0provides some clues. Researchers evaluated 24 studies looking at the psychological outcomes of people who were quarantined, an extreme form of social distancing, during outbreaks of SARS, H1N1 flu, Ebola and other infectious diseases since the early 2000s.\nMany\u00a0quarantined individuals experienced both short- and long-term mental health problems, including stress, insomnia, emotional exhaustion and substance abuse. For instance, one study compared quarantined versus non-quarantined individuals during an equine influenza outbreak. Of 2,760 quarantined people, 34 percent, or 938 individuals, reported high levels of psychological distress, which can indicate mental health problems such as anxiety and depression, during the outbreak compared with 12 percent of non-quarantined individuals.\nAnother study looked at the effects of the 2003 SARS outbreak on 549 hospital workers in Beijing. Those who were quarantined or worked in high-risk settings \u2014 almost half the sample \u2014 reported higher levels of alcohol abuse three years later than workers with less-intense exposure to the outbreak""}, {""start"": 3049, ""case_number"": 1, ""end"": 3702, ""text"": ""The potential for social distancing to become a long-term event is what worries psychiatrist Damir Huremovic of Northwell Health in Manhasset, N.Y.

I have been in the ER every day these last few weeks, either supervising or providing direct care. I contracted a COVID-19 infection very early in the outbreak, as did two of my daughters, one of whom is a nurse. We are all well, thank God.\n\nCOVID-19 has been the worst health care disaster of my 30-year \u00adcareer, because of its intensity, duration and potential for lasting impact. The lasting impact is what worries me the most. And it\u2019s why I now believe we should end the lockdown and rapidly get back to work.\n\nFrom mid-March through mid-April, the ER staff at St. Barnabas huddled in groups of about 20 every morning. We asked ourselves what had happened over the previous shift. We generated a list of action\u00adable tasks for the following 24 hours. At first, we addressed personal protective equipment and the management of patients with mild illness who were seeking COVID-19 tests.\n\nThen came the wave of critically ill patients in numbers none of us had ever seen. This lasted for two weeks. The number of patients on ventilators accumulated in the ER and throughout the hospital. We witnessed an unprecedented number of deaths. The tone of the huddles became more somber. We became accustomed to the morbidity; we did our jobs.\n\nIt is precisely what I have witnessed that now tells me that it\u2019s time to ease the lockdown. Here\u2019s why.\n\nFirst, the wave has crested. At 1 p.m. April 7, the COVID-19 arrivals slowed down. It was a discrete, noticeable event. Stretchers became available by 5 p.m., and the number of arriving COVID-19 patients dropped below the number discharged, transferred or deceased.\n\nThis was striking, because the community I serve is poor. Some are homeless. Most work in \u201cessential,\u201d low-paying jobs, where distancing isn\u2019t easy. Nevertheless, the wave passed over us, peaked and subsided. The way this transpired tells me the ebb and flow had more to do with the natural course of the outbreak than it did with the lockdown.\n\nSecond, I worry about non-coronavirus care. While the inpatient units remain busy with sick COVID-19 patients, our ER has been quiet for more than a week. We usually average 240 patients a day. For the last week, we averaged fewer than 100. That means our patients in this diverse, low-income community are afraid to come to the ER for non-COVID care.\n\nGotham-wide, the number of 911 ambulance runs declined to 3,320 on April 18, down from a peak of 6,527 on March 30, according to New York Fire Department data. The current nadir is significantly below the average.\n\nA large share of those staying home surely have emergency medical and surgical conditions not related to the novel coronavirus. The growing numbers \u00addying at home during this crisis must include fatal myocardial infarctions, asthma exacerbations, bacterial infections and strokes.\n\nMeanwhile, our pediatric volume in the ER has practically disappeared. Visits to primary-care pediatricians are also down, with vaccine schedules falling behind. Everyone seems to be avoiding the health system \u2014 an important and unfortunate consequence of the stay-at-home strategy.\n\nThird, inordinate fear misguides the public response. While COVID-19 is serious, fear of it is being over-amplified. The public needs to understand that the vast majority of infected people do quite well.\n\nFinally, COVID-19 is more prevalent than we think. Many New Yorkers already have the COVID-19 infection, whether they are aware of it or not. As of today, over 43 percent of those tested are positive in The Bronx. We are developing a significant degree of natural herd immunity. Distancing works, but I am skeptical that it is playing as predominant a role as many think.\n\nMore testing will better establish the numbers among those with mild illnesses and no symptoms. My professional \u00adexperience tells me the number of infected people will be high. Testing is important work, but it should happen in parallel to the immediate resuscitation of the economy and getting people back to work.\n\nAt present, the testing is \u00adimperfect. We can\u2019t wait months. We must protect the vulnerable and mitigate without destroying the economy.\n\nStanding up to this virus can\u2019t be the job of essential workers only. We\u2019ve been strong, but we\u2019re tired, and we need the rest of you to help us. By getting back to work.\n\nDaniel G. Murphy, MD, is chairman of the Department of Emergency Medicine at St. Barnabas Hospital in The Bronx""}]"

And those job losses took place in a system in which women already make up 66.6% of the workforce in the country\u2019s 40 lowest paying jobs.\n\n\nThe division of labor in the home places a heavier emotional burden on women too. In the U.S., 55% of employed women do housework compared to 18% of men, and women tend to spend twice the amount of time with their children than men do. When schools close and children are left with only remote learning, the burden to keep them focused and check their assignments falls disproportionately on women. In Latin America, the CARE study found, this disparity is even worse, with 95% of schools in the region shuttered and entrenched social practice putting virtually all of the childcare burden on women""}]"

In Bangladesh, where women are six times likelier than men to have been laid off during the coronavirus recession and where an astounding 100% of 542 women surveyed reported increased mental health problems, the emotional toll is exacerbated by lack of mobility\u2014either due to religious strictures that forbid women from leaving home without the accompaniment of a male family member or because of lack of access to public transportation. Either way, this limits their access to services like mental health care\u2014and in many cases, they sorely need it.\n\n\u201cWhen you ask women if their anxiety has gone up, they say \u2018Yes, and here\u2019s why: I\u2019m not sure how many more days I can feed my family.

Across the world, women are overwhelmingly likelier than men to be employed as housekeepers as well, and when lockdowns hit, many were faced with a terrible choice: they could quarantine with their employer\u2019s family and hold on to their job, or quarantine with their own family, and lose the source of income that made it possible to support them.\n\nBroader economic structures play a role too. In general, more women than men are employed in the informal economy or so-called gray markets\u2014outdoor stalls and bazaars that are often unlicensed and unregulated but that provide an income for millions. In a typical recession, it\u2019s formal businesses that tend to suffer while the ones at the fringes keep operating.
