1.01 cl Does the passage of reasoning in (or around the) bold font … (check all that apply):
1.01.01 State a faulty premise or assumption?
"""
This task guides you to find reasoning errors. But sometimes the problem with an argument is not flawed reasoning but just a flawed premise or assumption.

*A premise is a claim of fact that is meant to support an argument's conclusion.* Sometimes premises are assumed without being stated. Sometimes they are made explicit.

>E.g. "Since people show up here for food and not to watch sports, our broken television should not hurt our business." The assumption is that people come for food, not sports.

>E.g. In the following argument, the first sentence is an incorrect premise/assumption: "All swans are white. Bob has bought a swan. Therefore, Bob's swan must be white."

In fact, there exist black swans (and they are quite beautiful). The reasoning of the argument above is perfectly sound. But the conclusion is incorrect because one of the premises is false.

This task guides you to find reasoning errors. But sometimes the problem with an argument is not flawed reasoning but just a flawed premise or assumption.

*A premise is a claim of fact that is meant to support an argument's conclusion.* Sometimes premises are assumed without being stated. Sometimes they are made explicit. Choose this answer if you think there is a flawed premise or assumption relevant to the bold text that is not stated.

>E.g. "Nobody can win a 'best actor' award and a 'best supporting' actor award in the same year." Here, the unstated assumption is that actors can only be nominated for one award per year.
"""

1.01.03 Include flawed reasoning/inferences?
"""Inferences are conclusions drawn from premises and/or evidence. Most reasoning errors result from people drawing the wrong conclusions from premises or evidence.

>E.g. "Barbara is tall. And Susan is tall. Therefore, they are the same height." This reasoning is flawed because the conclusion cannot be proven by the premises/evidence. While both women may be tall, we don't have reason to believe they are precisely the same height.

1.05 cl You said there was some questionable evaluation of something as good or bad, appropriate or inappropriate. Do you see any of the following fallacies?
1.05.01 Just World Fallacy
"""Arguing that something must be just/fair/proper simply because it is the way society works.

> E.g. "This industry is hard on some ecosystems, and it can be tough on the loggers, but that is just how the world works. Everyone has to play their part."

>E.g. "The Senator's Uncle and Grandfather held seats of power for a half-century. So, it seemed fitting, like the revolution of some cosmic clock, that she would carry forward their legacy now."

*The things people do may be good or bad, but that can't be determined simply by comparing them to what has been accepted before.*"""

1.05.02 Good Old Days Fallacy
"""Assuming without good reason that the past was superior to the present or future.

The idea that things in the past were much better than the present in some unspecific way, or neglecting relevant ways in which the past was actually worse.

>E.g. "This new generation, with their TikTok & video games, will never understand how great it was to grow up in the 20th century. If they did, their so-called FOMO (fear of missing out) would destroy them."

>E.g. "Long gone are the times when you could walk down the street without encountering some person struggling just to live. Long gone is our Old California."
"""
1.05.03 Naturalistic Fallacy
"""Assuming the way things are implies the way things ought to be.

> E.g. "Nature gives people diseases and sickness; therefore, it is morally wrong to interfere with nature and treat sick people with medicine."

>E.g. "As the rain falls, and the sun shines, and the wheat grows in the fields, so mankind must always yearn for more beer."

*Yes, we like nature a lot. But associating your idea with nature, doesn't make your idea correct.*"""

1.05.04 Slippery Slope Fallacy
"""A chain of if-thens with dubious or false steps.

Promoting worries that some small change will somehow lead to a major catastrophic change.

> E.g. "If you break your diet and have one cookie tonight, you will just want to eat 10 cookies tomorrow, and before you know it, you will have gained back the 40 pounds you lost."

> E.g. "First, they come for the birdseed, but then the squirrels get greedy and they want into the house. Next thing you know, they're waking you up at 2am by jumping on your face and scratching at your eyes. That's why it's a terrible idea to put birdseed on the porch."

*Most small changes do not lead to large changes. Things may change, and some changes may lead to other changes, but it’s by no means inevitable.*
"""

1.05.05 Status quo bias
"""Status quo bias is the tendency to think the status quo is good, and change would only make things worse.

Change can make things either worse or better. Sometimes the status quo isn’t even stable, and keeping it isn’t a real option. The default is not always the safest choice.

> E.g. "I won’t change my cell phone service even though I hate them, because I’ve been with them too long."

> E.g. "We shouldn’t let any other political parties get time on the political debate stage, because we’ve always had a two party system."
"""

1.05.06 Sunk Cost Fallacy

"""Arguing for continuing something because time and resources have been spent on it.

Ideally, people should make their best calculation about whether more investment will really help, without regard for their prior investment.

> E.g. "With $700 Billion spent and many lives lost already, failure is not an option. We must send reinforcements."

1.13.01 Gambler’s fallacy
"""The idea that if things happened one way before, they will happen differently next time to balance things out.

> E.g. Consider a series of 4 coin flips that have all landed heads' side up. Under the Gambler's Fallacy, a person might predict that the next coin flip is more likely to land tails up. But the likelihood of the coin turning up heads is always 50%. Each coin flip is an independent event, which means that previous flips have no bearing on future flips.

>E.g "Our people have been down for too long. We are due for some better luck, and now is the time!"
"""
1.13.02 Stereotyping
"""Generalizing from a sample that is obviously too small.

Assuming that a member of some group has certain properties simply because their group is associated with those properties.
> E.g. "She's got Asian heritage, so she's probably really good at math."

>E.g. "He's from a middle class family on the East Coast, so he's probably a baseball fan."

>E.g. "They're American, what do you expect?"

*We don't need to pretend that every culture is exactly the same as all the others. But we also can't assume that the individuals within any group are all the same as each other. Take the time to see individuals as individuals.*
"""
1.13.03 Availability heuristic
"""Wrongly judging frequency or probability based on how easy it is to think of examples.

We tend to overestimate the general likelihood and frequency of things we’ve encountered recently (e.g. in the news), that are particularly vivid (e.g. a plane crash), or which we personally have encountered.

> E.g. After reading an article about a lottery winner, Helen started spending more money each week on lottery tickets.

*Reading about lottery winners doesn’t increase the likelihood of you winning, which is pretty much always extremely low. It just increases the salience of that very unlikely possibility.*

>E.g. Watching crime dramas can lead people to believe that crime is more prevalent than it is.

>E.g. "Everyone's talking about how the climate is changing. That's probably what caused yesterday's earthquake."

*There are a lot of careful studies people can read to learn about how the Earth's climate has changed over the last few thousand years. But there are probably better explanations for yesterday's earthquake than climate change, even if it is a topic that gets discussed a lot.*

"""
1.13.04 Hindsight Bias
 """Overestimating the probability of an event in favor of what actually happened.

Treating past ignorance as foolish simply because now we know more. Or, treating what has already happened as obvious and inevitable when few could have predicted it at the time.

> E.g. The musician Taylor Swift may have been experiencing the Hindsight Bias when she wrote the lyric: ‘I knew you were trouble when you walked in.’

*Since the song is about a person she had a relationship with, she probably did not think the person would be so troublesome. If she had, she wouldn’t have begun the relationship.*

"While the Yellow political party has rallied thousands of experts and scientists to create documentation showing how lead has seeped into the water supply and how it can be corrected, the spokeswoman for the Purple party insists that their own scientists have completed an independent study concluding that the levels of lead in the water are safe, even for small children." Here, the journalist has failed to provide any additional information or evaluation of the evidence from each side of this debate. They have merely offered a perspective from both sides, providing a false sense of balance to the newsreader, along with a sense that the issue can/should be decided by rhetoric instead of careful analysis.
